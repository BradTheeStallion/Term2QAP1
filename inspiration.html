                <hr>
                <p>My knowledge of car brands is so limited that some of my friends poke fun at me because I seem to know NOTHING. I have never owned a car and I won't until someone is impressed enough by my GitHub to offer me a job (don't worry, I'm not expecting a salary that could buy La Voiture Noire).</p>
                <p>As a child, I loved the cheesy old Batman tv series fro the 60s. This is probably why I thought of the Batmobile before, say, a Toyota... Protege?</p>
                <p>Please feel free to click the audio below to listen to the theme song of this tv show--but don't get mad at me if it gets stuck in your head all day!</p>

                <p>Of course, Bugatti's La Voiture Noire isn't a real Batmobile, and it isn't even the only car to have earned the comparison. But it <strong>is</strong> the one that motivated me to buid a webpage.</p>
                <p>I hope you enjoyed my webpage and a little information on where I drew inspiration from.</p>
