                <h2>Retrospective Questions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><em>How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)</em><br>I did not keep exact track of the time I spent on this assignment. I always had it open and would do it here and there throughout the day. There were times when I sat down and focused on it for longer periods of time as well. I did some extra tasks to keep me motivated. I am more interested in back-end than front-end, but this semester has definitely given some inspiration for front-end. If I had just stuck with HTML and CSS and done the minimum, it would have probably taken 6 hours. I would say I spent about 10 hours on this QAP including research and gathering media (photos, video, information, learning some JavaScript elements, etc.)</li>
                <li><em>What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)</em><br>I have used an abundance of information from the class lectures (Programming Concepts with JavaScript, Front-end, UI/UX) as well as some events I attended recently with Canada Learning Code and Get Coding.<br>Here is a list of websites I used to obtain knowledge for some things I did:
                <ul>

                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_tooltip.asp" target="_blank">W3 Schools (css tooltip)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.sololearn.com/en/compiler-playground/Wo28TqJpK08C/?ref=app" target="_blank">Sololearn (scroll overflow)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-background-image-with-html-example-code" target="_blank">Free Code Camp (css background image)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="flexboxfroggy.com" target="_blank">Flexbox Froggy</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/course/modern-javascript-from/9781789539509/" target="_blank">O'Reilly (Modern JavaScript From The Beginning)</a></li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><em>Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)</em><br>I didn't ask my friends for help directly, but I did ask many classmates for gentle stylistic feedback.</li>
                <li><em>Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?</em><br>I did not ask my instructors for help. I did however use AI tools throughout the assignment. GitHub Copilot helped with some small repetitive tasks and I did ask ChatGPT several questions (specifically about embedding a YouTube video, getting my ToolTip to work properly, getting an opaque background on this page, and teaching me how to do the calculator in the pricing section).</li>
                <li><em>Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of Making this all! from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.</em><br>I would definitely consider this level-appropriate for QAP 1 of semester 2. I didn't have any moments where I felt frustrated or wanted to give up. The most difficult part for me was getting myself interested in cars, but once I found the right car the inspitation came quickly. After completing this task, I am confident that I could create a similar-quality website in a fraction of the time.</li>

            <h2>Regrets</h2>
            <p>My one regret for this project is that I didn't make adjustments to accomodate different window sizes. I am still proud of what I built, but I wish it was adapted to look it's best on all screens.</p>
            <p>I also had a lot of trouble with file paths and had to revise them last minute in a less-than-organized way.</p>
